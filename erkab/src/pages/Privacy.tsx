          This is a draft notice for the Erkab Psychiatry platform. Final legal
          text must be reviewed by counsel before production use.
        </p>

        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <p>
          Account details, intake answers needed for matching, appointment and
          payment metadata, and (for providers) professional credentials stored
          privately.
        </p>

        <h2>How we use it</h2>
        <p>
          To match you with eligible psychiatrists, manage bookings, process
          payments through a payment provider, and operate the service. We do not
          sell personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>Access</h2>
        <p>
          Psychiatrists see only their own patients’ appointment information.
          Staff actions are recorded in an audit log. Card details are handled
          by the payment provider, not stored on Erkab.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          You may review privacy settings and request changes from your account.
          Applicable local data-protection rights will be supported as the
          service expands.
