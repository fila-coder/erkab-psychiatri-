          Draft terms for the Erkab Psychiatry platform. Final text must be
          reviewed by counsel before production use.
        </p>
        <h2>Service description</h2>
        <p>
          Erkab connects patients with independently licensed psychiatrists for
          scheduled video consultations. Erkab is not a medical provider and does
          not provide emergency care, diagnosis by the platform, or guaranteed
          clinical outcomes.
        </p>
        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You must provide accurate information and keep credentials secure.
          Psychiatrists must only accept bookings in jurisdictions where they are
          legally authorized to practise.
        </p>
        <h2>Payments and cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          Fees are shown before booking. Payment processing depends on a configured
          payment provider. Cancellation and refund rules are stated on the
          cancellation policy page and on each booking.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by law, Erkab is not liable for clinical decisions
          made by independent practitioners or for inability to obtain emergency
          care through the platform.
